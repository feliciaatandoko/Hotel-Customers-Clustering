# Hotel-Customers-Clustering

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset from a resort hotel and a city hotel in Portugal to uncover customer booking behaviors. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments to improve revenue management and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about customer bookings, including details such as booking times, length of stay, number of guests, customer profiles, financial transactions, and cancellation patterns. This comprehensive data provides valuable insights into how different types of customers interact with the hotels.

## Approach
Using clustering techniques, I identified two main customer segments: Planned Customers, who are budget-conscious and prefer early bookings, and Flexible Customers, who are willing to spend more and have varied preferences. By analyzing these segments, I developed targeted strategies for each group. For Planned Customers, I recommended advance booking promotions and flexible cancellation policies, while for Flexible Customers, I suggested last-minute deals and a range of services to enhance their experience.

## Results
This segmentation allows hotels to tailor their offerings effectively, aiming to boost revenue and improve overall customer satisfaction.
